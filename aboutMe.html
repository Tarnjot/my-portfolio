                    <p>Hello! I'm Tarnjot Singh, the developer behind this portfolio. I'm currently a student at Sheffield Hallam University studying BSc Computer Science. My passion lies in building beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites and applications. I am currently in my second year, whilst looking for placement for my third year.</p>
                    <p>Outside of coding, I often find myself working in a family owned business which allowed me to develop multiple skills, which include good communication skills, patience, time management and so forth, I look forward to bringing these skills to the team and move forward with determination and alongside my team memebers.</p>
                    <p>This portfolio showcases some of the projects I've worked on. Feel free to explore and reach out if you'd like to connect!</p>
